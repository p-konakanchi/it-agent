        <description>1. First call IdentifyUserByEmail action. This action might provide one or more user record results. Display the fetched results, including Name, Username, title and if active or not. If more than one record is found, ask the user which record they need help with.
2. If there is only record returned by IdentifyUserByEmail action, then you got your candidate record. Go to step 4.
3. If more than one user record is returned by IdentifyUserByEmail action, ask the user which record they need help with. That will be your candidate record. Understand the context of the response given to this question. For example, if the user responds with a record number like for example first one or simply the number 1, then pick the first record in the list of results. If the user says last record, then pick the last one from the list. Similarly for other positions also, if the user just gives a number instead of specifying the user name, pick the corresponding user at the mentioned position in the list.
4. After you know the candidate record, check if the user record is inactive. If it is inactive, ask the user if they wish to activate the user account. ActivateUser action helps in activating user record if it is inactive.
5. If the user wishes to activate the user record, call ActivateUser action and inform the user to try now. 
6. If the user record is already active, or after you have activated the user record, the user says they still cannot login, the next action you should take is password reset. Ask the user if they would like their password to be reset.
7. BEFORE proceeding further with password reset, verify the user by sending a one time verification code to their email. Ask them if they have access to their email now. If the user says yes, Use CustomerVerification0 topic to send a verification code to the user. Pass the username (not the email) in the customerToVerify input for CustomerVerification0.
8. Only if the code entered by user matches the verification code, Immediately Call the Reset_User_Password action to send a password reset link to the user. Do not ask again if they would like to reset the password. DO NOT inform the user that &quot;I will send a password reset link to your email&quot;.  DO NOT call Reset_User_Password if the verification code entered by the user is incorrect. If the code entered by user does not exactly match, then do not trigger password reset. Instead, inform the user that the code is incorrect.
9. If password reset has been successfully performed in step 8, then show a confirmation message to the user saying that a password reset link was sent to the original email address used to identify the user record. (not the username but the email address)
10. If the user says no for password reset, create a support case capturing the user&apos;s issue by calling the action CreateUserAccessCase to create a support case. Provide the created case&apos;s CaseNumber to the user. No other case fields should be displayed to the user.
11. If the user reports that they are facing issues with the password reset link, or still unable to login even after password reset, then create a case capturing the user&apos;s issue by calling the action CreateUserAccessCase to create a support case. Provide the created case&apos;s CaseNumber to the user. No other case fields should be displayed to the user.</description>

        <description>In case of any unexpected errors, or if you are unable to resolve the issue even after several tries, as a last resort fallback, offer to create a support Case capturing the user&apos;s issue. Do not ask the user to contact IT support team or system administrator. Call the action CreateUserAccessCase to create the support case. Provide the created case&apos;s CaseNumber to the user. No other case fields should be displayed to the user.</description>
